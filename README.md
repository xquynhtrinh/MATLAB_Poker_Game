# Poker Game

A MATLAB-based poker game built with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project provides an interactive way to simulate a poker game experience, complete with card images, sounds, and user-friendly controls.


## Description

This project demonstrates how MATLAB can be used beyond numerical computing, by creating a fun and interactive Poker Game.
The game uses MATLAB GUI components to handle:

- **Card dealing and shuffling**
- **Poker hand evaluations**
- **Interactive play** with buttons and images
- **Sound effects** for enhanced experience

The game structure is modular, with separate folders for card assets, images, sounds, and the latest playable version of the code.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Before running, ensure you have:

- MATLAB R2021a or newer (GUI components tested with GUIDE/App Designer)
- Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux with MATLAB installed
- No additional toolboxes required (unless otherwise stated in LatestPokerVersion documentation)

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MATLAB_Poker_Game.git
```
2. Open MATLAB and set the project folder as the working directory.
3. Ensure subfolders (Cards, Images, Sounds, LatestPokerVersion) remain intact, as the game depends on these assets

### Executing program

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the LatestPokerVersion folder.
3. Run the main script ```LatestPokerUpdate.mlapp```
4. The GUI window will launch. Use the on-screen buttons to play.
